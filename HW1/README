Matrix computation using pthreads.
Computes and prints the sum of a equally sized matrix.
Also the position and size of the both the maximum value and the lowest value are printed.
The values are randomly selected between 0-99.
The makefile produces 3 versions of the matrix application. Named a, b and c representing the assignments 1:a, 1:b and 1:c.
Standard and maximum value for MATRIX_SIZE is 10000. Minimum value is 1.
Standard value for NR_THREADS is 10.

write 'make' to build

Usage: x [MATRIX_SIZE] [NR_THREADS]
where x is a, b or c.
